Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.

Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

RHEL 8 functionality (e.g., RDP) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA).

In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

RHEL 8 uses /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of ""ClientAliveInterval"" and ""ClientAliveCountMax"" is used to establish the inactivity threshold. The ""ClientAliveInterval"" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The ""ClientAliveCountMax"" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.

Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.

Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's Information System Security Manager (ISSM)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

Notifications provided by information systems include messages to local computer consoles, and/or hardware indications, such as lights.

This capability must take into account operational requirements for availability for selecting an appropriate response. The organization may choose to shut down or restart the information system upon security function anomaly detection.

RHEL 8 comes with many optional software packages. A file integrity tool called Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is one of those optional packages. This requirement assumes the use of AIDE; however, a different tool may be used if the requirements are met. Note that AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so a cron job is recommended that uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity check.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.

init_on_free is a Linux kernel boot parameter that enhances security by initializing memory regions when they are freed, preventing data leakage. This process ensures that stale data in freed memory cannot be accessed by malicious programs.

SLUB canaries add a randomized value (canary) at the end of SLUB-allocated objects to detect memory corruption caused by buffer overflows or underflows. Redzoning adds padding (red zones) around SLUB-allocated objects to detect overflows or underflows by triggering a fault when adjacent memory is accessed. SLUB canaries are often more efficient and provide stronger detection against buffer overflows compared to redzoning. SLUB canaries are supported in hardened Linux kernels like the ones provided by Linux-hardened.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each syscall made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use syscall rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.

In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

RHEL 8 uses /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of ""ClientAliveInterval"" and ""ClientAliveCountMax"" is used to establish the inactivity threshold. The ""ClientAliveInterval"" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The ""ClientAliveCountMax"" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.

The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.

This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components that are, or use, such products. This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes in DOD or other government agencies.

There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.

Restricting access to the kernel message buffer limits access to only root. This prevents attackers from gaining additional system information as a nonprivileged user.

Invoking a system call is an expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace after the system call completes. Virtual system calls map into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls. This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context switching expense.

Virtual system calls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control of the return instruction pointer. Disabling virtual system calls help to prevent return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns. If the system intends to run containers based on RHEL 6 components, then virtual system calls will need enabled so the components function properly.

Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can be either hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.

Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification or reference to that page after being freed or before being initialized will be detected and prevented. This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost. Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.

init_on_free is a Linux kernel boot parameter that enhances security by initializing memory regions when they are freed, preventing data leakage. This process ensures that stale data in freed memory cannot be accessed by malicious programs.

SLUB canaries add a randomized value (canary) at the end of SLUB-allocated objects to detect memory corruption caused by buffer overflows or underflows. Redzoning adds padding (red zones) around SLUB-allocated objects to detect overflows or underflows by triggering a fault when adjacent memory is accessed. SLUB canaries are often more efficient and provide stronger detection against buffer overflows compared to redzoning. SLUB canaries are supported in hardened Linux kernels like the ones provided by Linux-hardened.

SLAB objects are blocks of physically contiguous memory. SLUB is the unqueued SLAB allocator.

Use of more characters in a password helps to increase exponentially the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.

RHEL 9 uses ""pwquality"" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. Configurations are set in the ""etc/security/pwquality.conf"" file.

The ""minlen"", sometimes noted as minimum length, acts as a ""score"" of complexity based on the credit components of the ""pwquality"" module. By setting the credit components to a negative value, not only will those components be required, but they will not count toward the total ""score"" of ""minlen"". This will enable ""minlen"" to require a 15-character minimum.

The DOD minimum password requirement is 15 characters.","CCI-004066

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open-source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.

It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs.

To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.

The impact of missing audit data is related to the type of object. A failure to capture audit data for objects used by identification, authentication, or authorization functions could degrade or eliminate the ability to track changes to access policy for systems or data. 

For Active Directory (AD), there are a number of critical object types in the domain naming context of the AD database for which auditing is essential. This includes the RID Manager$ object. Because changes to these objects can significantly impact access controls or the availability of systems, the absence of auditing data makes it impossible to identify the source of changes that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems throughout an AD domain. The lack of proper auditing can result in insufficient forensic evidence needed to investigate an incident and prosecute the intruder.

If an application allowlisting program is not in use on the system, this is a finding.

Configuration of allowlisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is an allowlisting application built into Windows Server. A deny-by-default implementation is initiated by enabling any AppLocker rules within a category, only allowing what is specified by defined rules.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:

Open ""PowerShell"".

If the AppLocker PowerShell module has not been imported previously, execute the following first:

Import-Module AppLocker

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:

Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML > c:\temp\file.xml

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.

Implementation guidance for AppLocker is available at the following link:

Severity Override Guidance: The AO can allow the severity override if they have reviewed the overall protection provided to the affected servers that are not capable of complying with the Credential Guard requirement. Items that should be reviewed/considered for compliance or mitigation for non-Credential Guard compliance are:

The use of Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) or similar products to control different local administrative passwords for all affected servers. This is to include a strict password change requirement (60 days or less).
â€¦.
Strict separation of roles and duties. Server administrator credentials cannot be used on Windows 10 desktop to administer it. Documentation of all exceptions should be supplied.
â€¦.
Use of a Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) and adherence to the Clean Source principle for administering affected servers. 
â€¦.
Boundary Protection that is currently in place to protect from vulnerabilities in the network/servers.
â€¦.
Windows Defender rule block credential stealing from LSASS.exe is applied.  This rule can only be applied if Windows Defender is in use.
â€¦.
The overall number of vulnerabilities that are unmitigated on the network/servers.","Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to protect data that could be used in credential theft attacks if compromised.

The use of Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) or similar products to control different local administrative passwords for all affected servers. This is to include a strict password change requirement (60 days or less).
....
Strict separation of roles and duties. Server administrator credentials cannot be used on Windows 10 desktop to administer it. Documentation of all exceptions must be supplied.
....
Use of a Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) and adherence to the Clean Source principle for administering affected servers. 
....
Boundary Protection that is currently in place to protect from vulnerabilities in the network/servers.
....
Windows Defender rule block credential stealing from LSASS.exe is applied. This rule can only be applied if Windows Defender is in use.
....
The overall number of vulnerabilities that are unmitigated on the network/servers.","Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to protect data that could be used in credential theft attacks if compromised.

","Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged and nonprivileged functions is greatly increased. 

All domain accounts must be enabled for multifactor authentication with the exception of local emergency accounts. 

Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Factors include: 

1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);
2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and
3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).

A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.

Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the internet).

Local access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.

1) Accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization. Organizations document specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication; and 
 
2) Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity.

Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For nonkernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. 
 
Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles.

This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with an operating system. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DOD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the approving authority (AO). Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. 
 
Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.","CCI-002418
